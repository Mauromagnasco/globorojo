Description
-----------

The internet is no longer credible, we need to elevate our social scoring to meet today's world demands. 
Globo Rojo is the first APP to use MERI.TO, an algorithm that makes your scores weigh as much as your own social validation. 
It lets you browse and share the web's best video-content, with a unique tagging system that allows you to validate yourself as a real content curator and niche influencer.
